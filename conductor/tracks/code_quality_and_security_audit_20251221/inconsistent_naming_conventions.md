# Inconsistent Naming Conventions and Style Issues

This document summarizes the findings of the code style analysis. The `laravel/pint` tool identified 148 style issues across 168 files. The following is a representative sample of the issues found.

## General Style Issues

- **`line_ending`**: Many files have inconsistent line endings.
- **`braces_position`**: Inconsistent placement of braces for classes, functions, and control structures.
- **`phpdoc_separation`**: Incorrect separation of phpdoc blocks.
- **`not_operator_with_successor_space`**: Missing space after the `!` operator.
- **`concat_space`**: Missing space around the `.` operator for string concatenation.
- **`ordered_imports`**: Imports are not ordered alphabetically.
- **`trailing_comma_in_multiline`**: Missing trailing comma in multiline arrays.

## Naming Convention Issues

Based on the `pint` output, there are no direct warnings about naming conventions (e.g., camelCase for methods, PascalCase for classes). However, the sheer number of style inconsistencies suggests a lack of a consistent coding style across the project. Applying a tool like `pint` will enforce a consistent style, which includes naming conventions implicitly.

## Files with a High Number of Issues

The following files have a high number of style issues and should be addressed first:

- `app/Http/Controllers/Api/ProductController.php`
- `app/Http/Middleware/SupabaseAuth.php`
- `src/Products/Application/CreateProduct.php`
- `src/Products/Application/SearchSimilarProducts.php`
- `src/Products/Application/SyncProduct.php`
- `src/Products/Infrastructure/EloquentProductRepository.php`
- `tests/Feature/ProductEndpointsTest.php`

A full list of files with issues can be generated by running `vendor/bin/pint --test`.
