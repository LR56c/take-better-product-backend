# Specification for Code Quality and Security Audit

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the specifications for a comprehensive code quality and security audit of the existing codebase. The goal is to identify areas for improvement in code consistency, uncover potential security vulnerabilities, and assess the quality and coverage of the existing tests.

## 2. Scope
The audit will cover the entire codebase, with a focus on the following areas:
- **Code Consistency:** Adherence to coding standards, consistent naming conventions, and uniform code formatting.
- **Security:** Identification of common security vulnerabilities, such as those defined by the OWASP Top 10.
- **Test Quality:** Evaluation of test coverage, effectiveness of assertions, and overall test structure.

## 3. Tools
The following tools and techniques will be used in the audit:
- **Static Analysis:** Automated tools to scan the code for potential issues.
- **Manual Review:** Manual inspection of critical code sections for subtle issues that automated tools might miss.
- **Test Coverage Analysis:** Tools to measure the percentage of code covered by tests.

## 4. Deliverables
The audit will produce the following deliverables:
- **Audit Report:** A detailed report summarizing the findings of the audit, including a list of identified issues, their severity, and recommendations for remediation.
- **Updated Code:** Code modifications to address the identified issues.
- **Improved Tests:** Enhancements to the existing tests to improve their quality and coverage.
